description: "The test was introduced by Turing in his paper, \" Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", while working at the University of Manchester (Turing, 1950; p. 460). It opens with the words: \"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'\" Because \"thinking\" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to \"replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.\""
